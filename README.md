Custom tooling for GameMaker Cronus

# Notice
You'll need to have the new runtime installed on your machine to make use of the building commands provided by Hera. Please do not ask for the new runtime. Additionally, required paths for the new runtime are stored in a `private.json` file that is not uploaded in this repo, please contact me if you have access to the new runtime and would like a copy of this file
